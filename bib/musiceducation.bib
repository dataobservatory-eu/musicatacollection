	shorttitle = {Music, Informal Learning and the School},
	abstract = {This pioneering book reveals how the music classroom can draw upon the world of popular musicians' informal learning practices, so as to recognize and foster a range of musical skills and knowledge that have long been overlooked within music education. It investigates how far informal learning practices are possible and desirable in a classroom context; how they can affect young teenagers' musical skill and knowledge acquisition; and how they can change the ways students listen to, understand and appreciate music as critical listeners, not only in relation to what they already know, but beyond. It examines students' motivations towards music education, their autonomy as learners, and their capacity to work co-operatively in groups without instructional guidance from teachers. It suggests how we can awaken students' awareness of their own musicality, particularly those who might not otherwise be reached by music education, putting the potential for musical development and participation into their own hands.   Bringing informal learning practices into a school environment is challenging for teachers. It can appear to conflict with their views of professionalism, and may at times seem to run against official educational discourses, pedagogic methods and curricular requirements. But any conflict is more apparent than real, for this book shows how informal learning practices can introduce fresh, constructive ways for music teachers to understand and approach their work. It offers a critical pedagogy for music, not as mere theory, but as an analytical account of practices which have fundamentally influenced the perspectives of the teachers involved.   Through its grounded examples and discussions of alternative approaches to classroom work and classroom relations, the book reaches out beyond music to other curriculum subjects, and wider debates about pedagogy and curriculum.},

    abstract = { Using the Music Preferences in Adulthood Model (MPAM, Bonneville-Roussy et al., 2017), an integrative model of the psychological determinants of musical preferences in adulthood, the main objective of this article is to investigate how different sources of social influences may affect age trends in musical preferences in adulthood. More specifically, we examine how the social network (such as family and peers), and psychological interpersonal dispositions (such as one’s psychological tendencies towards conformity) may influence these age trends. In two studies with a total sample size of over 950 adults, we examine how social influence variables are associated with age trends in musical preferences, measured with music genres and music clips (samples of musical audio recordings). Results revealed that the social network and interpersonal dispositions are related to preferences for different musical dimensions. These relationships were stronger for the musical genres dimensions as compared with the musical clips dimensions. In addition, our findings showed that dispositions toward conformity moderate the relations between age and musical preferences in adulthood. Those results confirm that social influences, especially the interpersonal disposition towards conformity, are important in the adoption of different musical preferences as adults evolve in age. The results are discussed within a lifespan developmental psychology of music perspective. }

    abstract = { This is a replication and further interpretation of Holbrook and Schindler’s study “Some Exploratory Findings on the Development of Musical Tastes” from 1989. Holbrook and Schindler’s investigation has been widely acknowledged in music psychology as well as in consumer research and has helped further the assumption that people generally cling to music and other cultural objects they get to know in late adolescence/early adulthood. In the current replication study, a peak in musical preference across song-specific age could be confirmed, but it shifted from 23.47 years in the original study to 17.36 years in the replication. This could possibly be explained by subjects’ earlier exposure to music and increased media familiarity. However, it could be shown that preferences at these peaks do not significantly differ from preferences at other ages. Also, the inverted U-shaped curve featured in the original study could not be observed among individuals’ ratings, which tend to prefer music which is either gradually older or else gradually younger than themselves. The U-shaped curve seems to emerge as an artefact of combining two types of rather linear data into one chart. In fact, no empirical evidence remains to sustain the overall cultural assumption which has its basis in Holbrook and Schindler’s study. It might still be valid, as evidenced by people having experienced the generation effect individually, but alternative research strategies will have to be developed to provide its empirical confirmation. }

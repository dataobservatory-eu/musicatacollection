abstract = {This demo presents LODStats, a web application for collection and exploration of the Linked Open Data statistics. LODStats consists of two parts: the core collects statistics about the LOD cloud and publishes it on the LODStats web portal, a front-end for exploration of dataset statistics. Statistics are published both in human-readable and machine-readable formats, thus allowing consumption of the data through web front-end by the users as well as through an API by services and applications. As an example for the latter we showcase how to visualize the statistical data with the CubeViz application.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a case study on publishing statistical data as Linked Open Data. Statistical or fact-based data are maintained by statistical agencies and organizations, harvested via surveys or aggregated from other sources and mainly concern to observations of socioeconomic indicators. In this case study, we present the publishing as LOD of the preliminary results of Greece's resident population census, conducted in 2011. We have employed the Data Cube vocabulary and the Google Refine tool for modelling and publishing the census results.},

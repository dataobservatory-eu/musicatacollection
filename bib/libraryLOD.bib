abstract = {The research starts from some questions left open by a previous study, which had demonstrated the possibility of creating in an automated way the class numbers of the Colon Classification of some works of Italian literature. The article examines the entire process of creating book numbers - an additional part to the class number envisaged by the Colon Classification - starting from the extraction of the necessary data from the Primo catalogue of the University of Udine and, by means of SPARQL queries, from the endpoint of data.bnf. fr. It is then shown how, through the use of the OpenRefine software, the data were organised and the notation of the publications examined was created. The research thus confirmed the possibility of automated or semi-automated creation of class numbers for works and demonstrated the feasibility of creating book numbers.},

The publication of large bibliographic data sets as LOD is a challenge that requires the design and implementation of custom methods for the transformation, management, querying and enrichment of the data. In this report, the methodology defined by previous research for the evaluation of the quality of LOD is analysed and adapted to the specific case of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples containing standard bibliographic information. The specified quality measures are reported in the case of four highly relevant libraries.},

Background
The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines describe modular standards that journals can adopt to promote open science. The TOP Factor is a metric to describe the extent to which journals have adopted the TOP Guidelines in their policies. Systematic methods and rating instruments are needed to calculate the TOP Factor. Moreover, implementation of these open science policies depends on journal procedures and practices, for which TOP provides no standards or rating instruments.
Methods
We describe a process for assessing journal policies, procedures, and practices according to the TOP Guidelines. We developed this process as part of the Transparency of Research Underpinning Social Intervention Tiers (TRUST) Initiative to advance open science in the social intervention research ecosystem. We also provide new instruments for rating journal instructions to authors (policies), manuscript submission systems (procedures), and published articles (practices) according to standards in the TOP Guidelines. In addition, we describe how to determine the TOP Factor score for a journal, calculate reliability of journal ratings, and assess coherence among a journalâ€™s policies, procedures, and practices. As a demonstration of this process, we describe a protocol for studying approximately 345 influential journals that have published research used to inform evidence-based policy.
Discussion
The TRUST Process includes systematic methods and rating instruments for assessing and facilitating implementation of the TOP Guidelines by journals across disciplines. Our study of journals publishing influential social intervention research will provide a comprehensive account of whether these journals have policies, procedures, and practices that are consistent with standards for open science and thereby facilitate the publication of trustworthy findings to inform evidence-based policy. Through this demonstration, we expect to identify ways to refine the TOP Guidelines and the TOP Factor. Refinements could include: improving templates for adoption in journal instructions to authors, manuscript submission systems, and published articles; revising explanatory guidance intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the TOP Guidelines; and clarifying the distinctions among different levels of implementation.
